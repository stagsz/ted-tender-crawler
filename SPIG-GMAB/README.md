# SPIG-GMAB Legacy Files

This folder contains the original SPIG-GMAB specific TED monitoring code that was used as the foundation for the generic Apify actor.

## Files in this folder:

- `spig_gmab_tender_monitor_clean.py` - Original SPIG-GMAB customized tender monitor
- `ted_fgt_monitor.py` - Legacy FGT monitor implementation 
- `ted_fgt_monitor_main.py` - Legacy main monitoring script
- `ted_fgt_monitor_operator_first.py` - Legacy operator-first search strategy
- `superclaude-context-plan.md` - SuperClaude framework documentation

## Purpose:

These files were specific to SPIG-GMAB's cooling systems and air pollution control business needs. They have been superseded by the generic Apify actor that can serve any industry.

## Note:

Keep these files for reference but use the generic actor in the parent directory for production deployment.
